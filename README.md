- 👋 Hi, I’m @yuriTato23 A.K.A Lisset R. 
- 👀 I’m interested in creating or fixing things, and solving puzzles; making programming a great fit for me, I really enjoy it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, C++, JavaEE, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, C#, SQL. Recently, I began diving into React and Spring. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can strengthen my skills or put them to the test.
- 📫 How to reach me: liristudies@gmail.com / Yeah get in touch but please don't SPAM! thx. ^-^
- 😄 Pronouns: she / her 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a Cuban woman who loves music and animation(anime). I would not say I'm a gamer though I can play and love mods(willing to contribute). I'm also very physically active outside of any programming time to stay fit.
